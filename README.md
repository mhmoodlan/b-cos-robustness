# A Quick Look at B-cos Nets' Adversarial Robustness

Repository containing checkpoint weights and jupyter notebook for generating results in [A Quick Look at B-cos Nets' Adversarial Robustness](https://mhmoodlan.github.io/blog/b-cos-robustness).

Work based on [B-cos networks](https://github.com/B-cos/B-cos-v2) (see paper: Böhle, M., Singh, N., Fritz, M., & Schiele, B. (2023). [B-cos Alignment for Inherently Interpretable CNNs and Vision Transformers. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.10898.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10898)).
